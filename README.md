# Salesforce Reports Connector
This salesforce reports connector allows users to log into Salesforce.com with their Salesforce credentials and pull down any report they have access to into a Qlik Sense app via the load script editor. You can either grab the source code and build the project here, or an installer will be available for download soon after it goes through beta testing.
